 ***To run this file you need to run this command in the terminal after changing to the file where the project exists :


     gcc main.c TNOVS_functions.c TOVS_functions.c Display_functions.c Bonus_functions.c -o app


 *** I apology for not implementing the bonus questions in a proper form and i did them just once cause they are the same for both tnovs and tovs
 
 *** There is a visual glitch that appears just in the overlapped records in tovs (in the delete and insertion) the problem is in the insertion function but it effected the delete in the display

 *** I didnt manage to add and fix this stuff due to short time but i think thats it in general thank you for reading this and going throw that long code for correction   :)
